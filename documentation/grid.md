##Using the Grid File

This file is deprecated and required manual import from the Bootstrap 4 codebase. This is no longer used and is slated for removal in a future version. For better and more consistent performance with a code library, Bower is used to pull in dependencies on the front-end making upgrades a matter of running an update command.
